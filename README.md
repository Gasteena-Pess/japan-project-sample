# japan-project-sample
Creating an entire augmented reality system for realistic scenarios like job interviews and public speaking involves a complex combination of technologies, including computer vision, natural language processing, and augmented reality. 
Developing such a system requires expertise in multiple domains, and the following is a simplified example in Python using OpenCV and some basic libraries. 
Please note that this is just a sample structure provided considering the time constraints, and a complete system would require much more development and testing.
The ar models and visuals are yet to be developed. Also there are many more modules to be developed in a well structured manner to make this idea complete and to make it function, which will require many more hours of working.

Provided are really basic structure or starting point for developing this project. 
Further development and detailed testing and technology integration would be required to completely generate this project.

THANK YOU!
